# JacketSpeak

Soundboard app to play Jacket's voice clips from Payday 2. Used for my cosplay project.

Built on Android 8.0 (Oreo). Used on a Moto Z smartphone.

I'm a total development newbie so a lot of this probably seems elementary or wrong to more experienced developers but bear with me. I'm learning and enjoying doing it. I'm also very new to the wide world of Git.


TODO

- Fix issues with Android 9
- See how app works when horizontal
- Change to ConstraintLayout
- Fix memory issue I don't know how to fix
